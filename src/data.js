  firstParagraph: `
i know i don’t always say how i feel
but every little thing here is made with love, just for you
this is me, trying to show what words can’t
i just hope when you see this
you can feel how much i truly love you
and i hope you’ll remember
my heart has always been yours.

i’m so proud of you
for everything you’ve done
and for the strength you carry so quietly
you’ve come so far and i hope you know
my heart is always with you
the day you were born became special to me too
because one day, you found your way into my life
since then, i’ve felt lighter, softer, and a little more like myself
you make everything feel calm and right
i’m so thankful it’s you..

i don’t say it often,
but you make my world feel softer
you’ve been one of the kindest parts of my story and i’m so lucky it’s you

hi my love
you’ve grown so much, and i see it
i see your effort, your heart, and everything you’ve become
i hope you keep shining in your own gentle way
i love you, more than i ever say ♡

you’re enough, you always have been
you don’t need to be more, or less
i see you, just as you are
and i love you that way

i love how you care for me, how you always try to be someone i can depend on, how you keep showing up even when it’s not easy. you make me feel safe, understood, and deeply loved
and that means more to me than you’ll ever know

i don’t know how long forever is,
but i know i’ll keep choosing you.
in every quiet way,
it’ll always be you.

with you, i don’t have to hide parts of me
i feel safe, seen, and understood
you’re my calm in every chaos
i hope we’ll always be each other’s safe place
where we can share our laughter and our tears

i don’t need perfect
i just want us to keep understanding, and choosing each other, always.

maybe we’re still learning, still growing, still figuring things out.
but as long as it’s with you, i know i’m right where i’m meant to be.

hi fariz pradipta ! i just wanna say this.. 
you’re my good parts, the calm in my chaos, my pink skies after the rain. even through thick and thin, i’ll always choose you!.
you’re my destiny, and i’d do anything 4 u ! 
i don’t know what forever means, but i know i want this — us, to last forever
